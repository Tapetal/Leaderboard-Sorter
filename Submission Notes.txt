LEADERBOARD SORTING SUBMISSION
================================

Setup Instructions:
1. npm install
2. Place leaderboard.xlsx in input/ folder
3. npm run dev (or npm run build && npm start)
4. Check output/ folder for results

Key Features Implemented:
✓ Total points ranking
✓ Spending tiebreaker (lower spending ranks higher)
✓ Countback system (highest score, occurrence count, 2nd highest, etc.)
✓ Alphabetical sorting with red highlighting (if all tiebreakers fail)
✓ Clean Excel output with formatting
✓ Detailed leaderboard with all event scores

Technology Stack:
- Node.js + TypeScript
- xlsx (reading)
- exceljs (writing with formatting)

Current Results:
- 25 players successfully ranked
- 0 unresolved ties (all tiebreakers worked)
- Winner: Team Overbudget (1080 points)

Additional Tiebreaker Suggestion:
If all tiebreakers fail, I suggest using "Most Recent Performance" 
(average of last 5 events) as it rewards current form and momentum,
which is valuable in competitive rankings.
